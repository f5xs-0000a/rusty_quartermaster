# Interface conventions

The single place that says how this app's interface is built. Every widget
follows these rules, so a new page should look like it belongs without anyone
having to compare it against an existing one by eye.

Each rule states the convention, the helper that implements it (a rule with a
helper is never hand-rolled at the call site), and how to verify it.

To check any rule against the real rendering, dump the interface and read it:

```sh
cargo run --bin gallery -- --out tmp/ui-gallery --prune
```

That writes each state twice. The `.txt` dump is the character grid, which is
what a rule about alignment or spacing is checked against. The `.svg` keeps
the colours and modifiers the text necessarily drops, which is what a rule
about focus or emphasis is checked against; `index.html` shows them all on one
page.

## Rule 1: Widget titles are offset

A widget's title sits **on** its top border, left-aligned, inset from the
corner by a short run of border rule and separated from the rule on both sides
by exactly one space.

Reading left to right along the top border:

1. the top-left corner, `┌`
2. a run of exactly three `─`
3. one space
4. the title text
5. one space
6. the border's own `─` run, continuing to the top-right corner, `┐`

The Inventory widget on the Profits page:

```
┌─── Inventory ──────────────────────────────────────┐
```

The two spaces are the point of the rule: they are what hold the title clear
of the border rule so the text reads as a label rather than as part of the
frame. The leading three-dash run is what keeps the title off the corner.

The title is left-aligned, so widening a widget lengthens only the trailing
run. At its minimum width the two runs are equal and the title reads as
centered:

```
┌─── Inventory ───┐
```

### The title sets a floor on the widget's width

A widget sized to its contents can come out narrower than its own title needs.
The title is not truncated when that happens; the trailing run is eaten
instead, down to nothing, leaving the title jammed against the corner:

```
┌─── Voyage Type ┐
```

So a widget's width is **never** just what its contents need. It is the larger
of the two:

```
width = max(content_width, len(title) + 2 * TITLE_DASHES + 4)
```

which with `TITLE_DASHES = 3` is `len(title) + 10`, accounting for:

| part                      | columns      |
| ------------------------- | ------------ |
| left and right corners    | 2            |
| leading run               | `TITLE_DASHES` |
| trailing run              | `TITLE_DASHES` |
| the spaces flanking it    | 2            |
| the title itself          | `len(title)` |

`Voyage Type` is 11 columns, so its widget may never be narrower than 21. Its
five entries only needed 18, which is how the trailing run vanished.

### Implementation

Take the block and the width from one call, `utils::titled_block`, so sizing a
widget to its contents cannot quietly drop the floor:

```rust
let (block, width) = titled_block("Voyage Type", max_name as u16 + 6);
let list = List::new(items).block(block.padding(Padding::horizontal(1)));
```

The width it hands back already has `max` applied, so it is the width to use.
Both halves matter; a caller that keeps only the block is the bug this rule
exists to prevent.

Never build the title string by hand. The leading run's length lives in one
place, `utils::TITLE_DASHES`.

The two lower-level helpers remain for cases that need them:

- `utils::offset_title` returns the title string and the same floor, for a
  widget that needs an unusual block (different borders, no borders).
- `utils::offset_title_width` is a `const fn`, so a widget can derive a layout
  floor at compile time from the same source the title comes from and the two
  can never drift:

  ```rust
  const MIN_W: u16 = offset_title_width("Inventory");
  ```

Both assume an ASCII title, where byte length equals column count, which all
of ours are.

### Verifying

In any dump, a correct title matches `┌─── <title> ─`, with a trailing run of
at least three. A title touching a corner, missing either space, or with a
leading run of any length other than three is a violation.

Checking it across the whole interface is a scan of the `.txt` dumps for

```
[┌├](─+) (title) (─*)[┐┤]
```

asserting the leading run is exactly three and the trailing run at least
three. At the time of writing the gallery draws 39 distinct titles and all of
them pass.
